This is a Weather application project it is built using HTML CSS and Javascript.

In this application, you can view the weather of any location in the world. This application presents you with the data in a well-detailed form like the Condition of clouds, windspeed, etc 

In this project, I have utilised the API provided by openweathermap.org. 

This application gives you the ability to search any location in the world, the user will be provided with a search bar to input the location.

Also in this, I have utilised the browser navigator function to detect the current location of the user and present the weather of the current location. For this, I have created a Location pointer button and users have to just click on that.

Also in this Unsplash API is used to set a different background for every page refresh.
